# pyBall

Python library for communicating with iBall/SpaceWriter devices.

If using a PL2032 adapter for the serial port, you may need to run this on Windows XP.
I developed this code with [pySerial 2.7](https://pypi.org/simple/pyserial/) and [python 2.7.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/) on a Windows XP VM.

The code should also be compatible with python 3.6 and run on linux with little to no adjustment.

More information on the devices and setting them up can be found in [this thread](https://groups.google.com/g/nottinghack/c/iUsJLSxgdQE?pli=1) in the Nottingham Hackspace group.

Please check the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/DeeHants/pyBall) for the latest updates.
